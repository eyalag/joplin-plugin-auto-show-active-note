# Joplin Plugin- Auto Show Active File In Side Bar

This [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) auto open the current note in the Notebooks sidebar.
Basically this auto execute the joplin command `focusElementSideBar` (shortcut `Shift+Cmd+S`).

This functinalluty was missing and it exist in all modern IDEs (see for example vscode settings `explorer.autoReveal`)

#### How to enable
After adding the plugin, you can toggle it form 'settings->plugin->Auto Show Active Note'

**Side note**

I would be happy to see this feature integrated in the main app branch instead have it in a plugin.
